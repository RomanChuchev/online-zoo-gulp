                    The site was founded on the basis of a volunteer movement to
                    protect and care for animals.

                <p class="backstage__text">
                    The main goal is to help the animals, as well as the nature
                    reserves and zoos where they are kept. We are currently
                    working on video projects targeting pandas in China, eagles
                    on an island near Los Angeles, alligators in Florida and
                    gorillas in the Congo. These have a total of more than 1,500
                    mammals and reptiles.
