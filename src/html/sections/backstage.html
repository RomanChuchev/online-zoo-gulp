          The site was founded on the basis of a volunteer movement to protect
          and care for animals.

        <p class="section-backstage__text">
          The main goal is to help the animals, as well as the nature reserves
          and zoos where they are kept. We are currently working on video
          projects targeting pandas in China, eagles on an island near Los
          Angeles, alligators in Florida and gorillas in the Congo. These have a
          total of more than 1,500 mammals and reptiles.
